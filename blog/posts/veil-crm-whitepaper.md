# AI-Enhanced Blockchain CRM for Onboarding and Customer Engagement in Web3

## Abstract

The rapid adoption of Web3 technologies has introduced complex barriers for non-technical users entering the crypto ecosystem. From wallet creation to understanding decentralized finance (DeFi) and governance, onboarding users remains a challenge. This white paper presents a blockchain-integrated AI Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution designed to simplify onboarding, drive user engagement, and enhance customer loyalty. By combining AI-powered CRM agents with blockchain's transparency and decentralization, we aim to revolutionize how Web3 platforms interact with their communities.
